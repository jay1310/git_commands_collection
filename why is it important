GitHub functions as a sort of social media site for developers and programmers. It allows your work to get out in front of the public. It is one of the largest coding communities around, so using it can provide wide exposure for your project. The more people you have to review your project, the more attention and use it is likely to attract.

For instance, imagine that you have the basic skeleton for a project. The project does what you want it to do, but you’re not always sure how the wider population will implement it—or if it even works for everyone.

This is where GitHub users step in. When you post your project on GitHub, the wider community of programmers and hobbyists can download and evaluate your work. They can alert you to possible issues, such as conflicts or unforeseen dependency issues. They may even propose solutions to those problems, saving you the work.
